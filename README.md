The point of this repo is to replicate the results obtained by Sean Case and documented here https://sean-case.github.io/avcedgetrump.html and here https://github.com/Sean-Case/WisconsinElection2016

He found that counties with the Edge voting machine gave Trump an advantage vs those that didn't. Sean was quite conservative when interpreting those results, suggesting that a forensic analysis would be needed to prove cheating, but I'm unaware of any remotely plausible explanations that don't involve malfeasance.

Let's see what we find when we attempt to replicate the work with fresh downloads from the elections.wi.gov, an independently created code base, and an independent take on the methods for ascertaining statistical significance.
